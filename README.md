# crackbowl
Crackbowl is a quiz bowl application designed to be an improvement of a similar application, "Protobowl."

Currently in development, Crackbowl offers some unique features to help users improve their quiz bowl skills. Crackbowl can show the user statistics on questions organized by subject and subsubject (ex. science and physics), and keeps a running list of all questions seen.

The other main advantage of crackbowl is its user-friendliness and design. Protobowl has a a mobile app, but it has several problems that makes it virtually unusable on most devices and connections. Crackbowl is designed to be mobile-friendly; its interface is clean, simple, and modern, and will load quicker and more reliably than Protobowl.

Full multiplayer capabilities are planned and will be implemented soon, check back here for updates.
